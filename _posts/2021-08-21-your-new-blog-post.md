# Data Science and Statistics
Data science is all about the intersection of math and statistics, analytics, and business. An effective data scientist should be able to clean data, code, and problem solve.   
While both data scientists and statasticians need to know how to do statistical analysis, understand programming languages and be able to think critically, a data scientist has a slightly broader scope. Data science often focuses on software engineering an machine learning whereas statistics is more focused on academia or research. Additionally data scientists tend to work on real-world problems, while statisticians focus more on theoretical models.  
As someone who is hoping to continue my education with a masters degree in data science/analytics, I see myself as more of a data analyst than a statistician.
