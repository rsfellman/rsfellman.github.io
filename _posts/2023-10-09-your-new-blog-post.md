# Project 2
In project 2, I created a vignette that detailed accessing and exploring data from an API. I used the earthquake API from the USGS and created functions to pull data from the API and output it in a user friendly format as a tibble. From my exploratory data analysis, I found that most earthquakes tend to be smaller/of a lower magnitude, but earthquake magnitude may depend on location. I also found that there are various methods for measuring magnitude, and most of these methods work best for certain magnitude ranges. So, the method used was often different for smaller vs. larger earthquakes.

This project took me a very long time, probably because I was trying to do better on project 2 than I did on project 1. I included many more comments in my code and while it did take longer on the front end, it made my code easier to edit when I wanted to make changes. I did learn how to make maps with `ggplot2` which was fun since it reminded me of ArcGIS which is something I enjoy. If I were to do a similar project in the future I would choose an API with more useable variables that were easier to interpret. I would also select and API that had data on a topic I am more familiar with. I do have some knowledge on earthquakes but I wouldn't say it is my strongest subject so this made it more difficult for me to interpret the data.
