# Exploratory Data Analysis

When doing exportatory data analysis, my main goal is to learn more about the data. Typically I start by looking at the variables I have. This can include examining the type of variable (numeric, categorical, continuous, etc.). I also try to determine if there are a lot of missing values for certain variables because it makes them harder to analyze.  
I will ususally then move onto looking at measures of center and spread for individual variables. This can be done with graphs like histograms or mathematically with calculations of mean, standard deviation, etc. Next, I will examine relationships between variables with scatterplots or correlation calculations. This is a good point to pause and look for patterns or anomalies/outliers in the data that could affect the models we make later on. Graphs like boxplots are helpful for identifying outliers.  
It is important to use a variety of methods including graphs and numerical summaries when doing exploratory data analysis so that we can get a broader understanding of the data. Looking at only one variable in only one manner can be limmiting and won't procide a full view of the data. It is also a good idea to put aside assumptions we may have about the data when doing EDA, so that we can more openly gain new insights.
