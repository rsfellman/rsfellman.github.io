# Project 3
If I were to do something differently for this project it would probably be more tests on the front end to make sure that my documents are rendering correctly and the pages are forming. I had a some trouble with that at the end and it was a bit stressful. (Mostly my .md files took forever to render.) My partner and I ended up using the approach with 2 separate branches that we had to merge which created a few merge conflicts. Since we didn't end up working on the project at the same time, I think it could have been easier if we both worked on the main branch instead of separate branches, so next time I might take that approach. 

The most difficult part was creating the model that was not explained in class. Since I didn't have a very good background on other models, I had to do some prior research to find a model that would make sense for our data and I ended up having to troublshoot a few times to make that model work. I was also confused by the logloss metric but with help from the class discussion was able to use it effectively in our project.

One of my biggest takeaways from this project are that there are many different ways one can model data and that if you have the time/computational power, it can be a good idea to test a few models to see which performs the best. Another takeaway would be that besides just writing the code, getting it to function correctly on github is a whole other challenge as well.
